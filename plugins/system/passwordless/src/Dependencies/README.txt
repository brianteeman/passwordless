This folder contains the third party dependencies, with their namespaces changed so as not to conflict with different
versions of the same dependencies shipped with Joomla! itself.

To find out which dependencies are installed and their licenses, please consult the composer.json and composer.lock
files in the plugin's public GitHub repository: https://github.com/akeeba/passwordless
